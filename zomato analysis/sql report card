Project Objective :
                             The project involved analyzing customer behavior on the Zomato platform, which is a food delivery, sales, and customer. The data used for the analysis was about Zomato sales based on membership, which contained information about sales, customers, products and membership.

Provided Task :
                        The task was to use SQL queries to answer several questions about customer behavior on Zomato. The sample questions included: what is the total amount each customer spent on Zomato, how many days has each customer visited Zomato, what was the first product purchased by each customer, what is the most purchased item on the menu, which item was most popular for each customer, and which item was purchased first by a customer after they became a member. 

Project Approach :
                              We approached the project first and had to clean the data to ensure that it was in a usable format. Checked any missing values and dealing with any data quality issues. Then used SQL queries to extract the data from the Zomato dataset and performed aggregate calculations on the data to answer the questions.

Analysis Report :
                         The result of the analysis showed that the most popular products on Zomato were product1 and product3.  As based on the customer membership the Zomato points for user 1 and user 2 earned the Zomato points and the highest points earned as per product was p3 is 3045 points. These insights helped to provide a better understanding of customer behavior on Zomato and will be useful for making informed decisions.
